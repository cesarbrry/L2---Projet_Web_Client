# L2 // Projet Web (Client)
Portfolio Website ( Second year project )

This project is a virtual portfolio created entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It is one of the main projects of my second year of computer science degree.

The site had to be responsive, have several pages including two login pages 
(one to create an account and one to log in).
